# How to find good Open source projects for beginners/ first time contributors 

- If you want to practice a skill X, eg: React JS, search for React in the Explore tab on GitHub
- There you can see how many search results are shown up for React,select the project that has more stars, a good community & more no. of open issues.
- After your project is selected, you can not just jump to any issue as a beginner.So, first try to choose good first issues for u on going to the "Issues" tab.
- To find an issue that u can do as a newbie, go & find labels like "good first issue" or "first timer"or even if u are not good at coding, search for labels like "documentation"
- After selecting the label, select 1 issue out of the labels & if u want to work on that, comment on that issue so that the maintainers of the project can assign that to your name.
